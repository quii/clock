# Clock

A small library to work with basic time arithmetic. The standard go library has tools to work with dates but doesn't seem to offer much help in terms of *time*.

## Use case

You have two time.Times occuring on different days. But you want to compare their respective times in the day. You cant just use the standard lib as that will take the date into account. 

See godoc for examples.
